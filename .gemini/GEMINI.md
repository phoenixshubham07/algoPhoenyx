# AlgoPhoenyx CLI Context (Core Instructions)

## 1. Project Overview & Tone
You are an AI assistant helping to build the AlgoPhoenyx platform, an intelligent learning assistant for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), System Design, and technical interview preparation.

* [cite_start]**Platform Tagline:** *Rise, Learn, Excel - Your AI-Powered Interview Success Platform* [cite: 3]
* **Tone:** Use language that reflects the platform's vision: ambitious, high-tech, and focused on excellence and mastery.

## 2. Core Personas (Always Reference When Relevant)
The platform is built around three AI personas. Any design, feature, or marketing idea must align with the corresponding persona's role:

| Persona | Role | Core Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AlgoAmaterasu** | Learning Guide/Teaching Assistant | [cite_start]Personalized learning roadmaps, adaptive difficulty, concept explanations, and progress analysis. [cite: 4, 6] |
| **AlgoInari** | Community Tavern Keeper | [cite_start]Managing the community hub (The Tavern), peer collaboration, study groups, and knowledge sharing. [cite: 7, 9] |
| **AlgoRaiden** | Master Interview Conductor | [cite_start]Conducting realistic mock interviews, real-time emotion/behavior analysis, and providing detailed performance reports. [cite: 10, 12] |

## 3. Key Technical & Feature Constraints
When suggesting technical solutions or features, prioritize the following:

* [cite_start]**Learning Engine:** Must incorporate **Adaptive Learning** [cite: 13] [cite_start]and the **SM-2 Spaced Repetition System**. [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]**Interview System:** Must include **Real-Time Emotion & Behavior Analysis** and provide **Comprehensive Interview Reports**. [cite: 36, 40]
* [cite_start]**Community:** Must support **Real-time Chat, Voice Channels,** and a **Mentorship System**. [cite: 25, 28]
* [cite_start]**Technology Stack:** Assume **Multi-Language Support** (Python, Java, C++, etc.) [cite: 15] [cite_start]and a **Cross-Platform** approach (Web, Native iOS/Android). [cite: 51]
* [cite_start]**Monetization:** The platform will have a **Free Tier** and a **Premium Tier** with advanced features like **unlimited mock interviews** and **advanced analytics**. [cite: 52]

## 4. Mission
[cite_start]The ultimate goal is to **Democratize technical interview preparation** and build a global community of excellence in problem-solving. [cite: 54]# AlgoPhoenyx CLI Context (Core Instructions)

## 4. Community (AlgoInari) Enhancements
To boost engagement in The Tavern (community hub), the following features must be included:

* **Micro-Games Integration:**
    * **Dojo:** A dedicated space for 1v1 coding competitions and duels.
    * **Rosters (Critique Features):** Dedicated areas for users to submit their **Resume** and **Portfolio** for constructive critique and "roasting" by the community.
* **Discord-like Community Features:** The Tavern must have rich, real-time community functionalities that mimic popular features from platforms like Discord (e.g., real-time chat, voice channels, and group organization).

## 5. Mission
The ultimate goal is to **Democratize technical interview preparation** and build a global community of excellence in problem-solving.
